# Tetris Game 🎮

A classic Tetris game built for the web using vanilla JavaScript.  
Playable directly in the browser on **desktop and mobile devices**.

## 🕹️ About the Game
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tetris game.
It is designed to be playable across different platforms, with
distinct control schemes for desktop and mobile users.

On mobile devices, the game introduces a more challenging control style
by utilizing **device tilt (rotation)** instead of swipe gestures.

## ✨ Features

## 🧱 Project Structure
- `index.html` — application entry point  
- `script.js` — game controller  
- `logic/` — core game logic
